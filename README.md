# lefreut's Enhanced UI for BG1EE, SoD, BG2EE and EET

The goal of this mod is to provide an unified and improved UI for Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition games. It allows you to play the whole saga with the same UI.

## Compatibility

For EE version 2.5, use the v4.3.2 version of this mod.

## Installation

### Windows

If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version. LeUI is packaged and installed with WeiDU.

To install, extract the contents of the archive into your game folder (the folder which contains the chitin.key file) and then double-click setup-LeUI.exe and follow the instructions on screen.

### Install Order

LeUI should be installed *before* EEUITweaks.

LeUI should be installed *before* mods that patch the UI (Sword Coast Stratagems, Tome & Blood, Might & Guile, Shadow Magic, Deities of Faerun, or Faiths & Powers).

LeUI *is not compatible* with other UI overhauls mods (Dragonspear UI++, Revised Dragon Scale, ...).
